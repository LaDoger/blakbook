# blakbook

**blakbook** is a text editor with **black** background (or **blackground**).

**blakbook** is opened by a browser and we can type text and *save the whole page* as an .html file with `ctrl + s`.

The text will be reserved and can be opened in the future for further editing!

### Some Tips
- Choose a **black** browser theme for absolute **blackness**!
- Open **blakbook** in a small independent window at the screen corner so your boss won't see!
- I haven't come up with a third tip yet.

### Shortcuts
- `ctrl + s` : save.
- `ctrl + b` : **bold**.
- `ctrl + i` : *italic*.
- `ctrl + u` : underline.
- `ctrl + +` : bigger.
- `ctrl + -` : smaller.
- `ctrl + p` : print.
