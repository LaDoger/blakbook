# blakbook

**blakbook** is a text editor with **black** background (or **blackground**).

**blakbook** is opened by a browser and we can type text and save the website as a .html file with `ctrl + s` and the text will be reserved and can be opened in the future for further editing!

### Some Tips
- Choose a **black** browser theme for absolute blackness!
- Open **blakbook** in a small independent window in the screen corner so your boss won't see!
- I haven't thought up of a third tip.
